"Inochi2D and the accompanying tools are still heavily work-in-progress. "
"They are usable for usecases we officially support, but it's still "
"evolving very quickly so we can't promise that it is ready for game "

"improved with time to be easier to use."

"Inochi Creator uses ImGui to render its UI, as of current ImGui does not "

"languages will only render properly if you set Inochi Creator to that "

" font shaping (eg. Arabic) as well as right-to-left languages currently "
