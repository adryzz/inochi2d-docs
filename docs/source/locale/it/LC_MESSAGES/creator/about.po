"Inochi Creator is an open source editor for the `Inochi2D puppet format "
"<https://github.com/Inochi2D/inochi2d>`_. This application allows you to "
"rig models for use in games or for other real-time applications such as "
"`VTubing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTuber>`_. Animation is achieved "
"by morphing, transforming and in other ways distorting layered 2D "
"textures in real-time. These distortions can trick the end user in to "
"perciving 3D depth in the 2D art."
